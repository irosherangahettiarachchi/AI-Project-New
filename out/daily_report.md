## Listing Issues

```json
[
    {
        "status": "FAIL",
        "issues": [
            "Over-promising: The listing claims 'High Quality' without providing specific data or certifications to support this claim. This could be considered subjective and potentially misleading.",
            "Grammar errors: 'High-quality construction for lasting durability.' should be 'High-quality construction ensures lasting durability.' or 'High-quality construction for lasting durability'",
            "SEO Length: The SEO title 'Generic Product 24 - Buy Online | High Quality Accessory' is within the recommended length, but the SEO description 'Get your high quality Generic Product 24 today! A versatile accessory designed to meet your needs. Lightweight and durable. Shop now!' is acceptable but could be more descriptive and keyword-rich to maximize SEO benefit.",
            "Missing Information: The bullet point 'Perfect for [Insert Target Audience/Use Case here, if known].' is incomplete and requires specific information to be useful. It should be replaced with a concrete target audience or use case.",
            "Description Vague: The description is very generic and doesn't provide specific details about the product's features, benefits, or applications. It needs to be more informative to engage potential customers."
        ],
        "sku": "SKU-1024"
    }

*   **Grammar Errors:** Correct the grammatical error for improved readability and professionalism.
*   **SEO Optimization:** The SEO description should be enhanced with more relevant keywords and specific product details to improve search visibility.
